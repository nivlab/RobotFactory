cspu6oze190o8a7gb4wvbkgp,1,1,4,5,5,Didn't write anything down. I associated the symbols with yes (space) or no (nothing) to help me remember. Towards the end I thought I should see if there was a pattern to how they were coming and whether or not a change in the pattern would cause the robot to misfunction. I wish I would have thought to do this sooner because I'm curious if there was a rhyme or reason to when it would malfunction.,The malfunctioning was frustrating and very confusing at first...sometimes I thought I was going crazy until I figured out for sure which symbol went with accepting/rejecting. It was a really fun task and I'd love to do more!
