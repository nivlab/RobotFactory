Sometimes, it was difficult because when I thought it would be +10, it would say -10, so I had a little more difficult time finding the pattern on this one. If there is even a pattern, because sometimes when it would be +10 the next time, that symbol would be -10 or -1, so it was a bit difficult to figure out/ maybe it's random, I'm not sure.",Thank you for the opportunity to participate! :) These are really interesting and fun to try to figure out the symbols and points.
