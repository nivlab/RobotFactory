cspu6oze190o8a7gb4wvbkgp,3,1,4,5,5,Didn't write anything down. It was pretty easy to remember once I figured out which symbols went with what. I realized early on that each color has exactly one reject and one accept so that helps me sort it out a bit quicker.,Still trying to figure out if there's a rhyme or reason to the malfunctioning...it's making me crazy! ha ha

I couldn't figure out if there was a certain way the symbols looked that would make it so I would need to reject or accept them.

sr0xjnvm85vs64bpp2vniu0u,3,1,4,5,5,Wrote down.  At the beginning there are about 2 rounds of exploration until the answers converge on the true classification after which I could do exploitation on the answers.  Looks like there's about a 25% inaccuracy rate so 2 rounds is about sufficient to know the true classification.,"Interesting study, would be interested in learning more about it after it's finished."
