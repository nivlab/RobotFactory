wgcsr4pnqf9h06ddy7r1g63l,1,20.56,0,8,4,4,4,0,2,4,5,I tried to remember which letters were more prone to need repair.,This was definitely a challenge. I feel I did better on block 1 than block 2 and not sure if it was set up this way.
wjuznyire06f4o925gpxsrj9,1,36.23,80,4,5,6,10,0,2,4,5,"I tried to pay attention and notice which letters on the robots tended to be closer to 50/50 in terms of correct/incorrect and I opted not to press space bar for those.  Then I would devote more attention to the letters that more frequently needed a press of the spacebar...  For those letters, I would try to come up with a simple pneumonic.  For instance, it seemed that V and K required pressing the space bar, so I remembers V and K as 'Viking' and I would say that over-and-over in my head.",I found that the HIT timer was about to run-out so I submitted the HIT with my worker ID and I will send a follow-up message with the completion code as soon as I complete the post-task survey
