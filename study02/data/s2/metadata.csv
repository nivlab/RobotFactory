2b5obc6ufsggq6sv58asdi6i,2,29.3,0,4,4,5,4,0,4,5,5,"Initially, I had to guess which robots needed repair versus which robots should be ignored. I paid attention to the points awarded until I was able to establish a pattern of which robots to repair/ignore. I also paid attention to any of the robots changing repair/ignore status throughout the game. Since this version of the game had symbols on the robots, I associated the symbols with something familiar (for example, one of the symbols looked like an upside down house and others looked like letters). This helped me remember the robots a bit more vividly since the symbols were not familiar to me.  ",This was a very interesting study. Thanks for the opportunity.
