I tried to identify which robots needed repair and paid attention to trends in points values changing that would indicate the robot had changed status from needing repair to not needing repair. ,This was a very interesting study. It was definitely a bit more challenging as more symbols were introduced but I enjoyed it and appreciate the opportunity.
